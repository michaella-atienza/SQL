SQL Portfolio for Data Analysis
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio, showcasing my proficiency in data analysis using SQL. In this collection, you'll find a variety of SQL queries that demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful insights from datasets. I've utilized the SQLite and PostgreSQL dialects to explore and analyze data. From exploring Netflix movie data to diving into Pokemon statistics, this portfolio covers a range of topics!

Feel free to explore the queries and analyses presented in this portfolio. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my approach to data analysis, feel free to reach out.
